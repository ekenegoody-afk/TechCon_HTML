            <h2>History of TechCon</h2>

            <p>
                TechCon began in 2010 as a small gathering of technology enthusiasts who
                wanted to create a platform for innovation, collaboration, and knowledge sharing.
                Over the years, it has evolved into one of the most influential global tech
                conferences, attracting developers, engineers, researchers, and industry leaders
                from around the world.
            </p>

            <p>
                By 2015, TechCon expanded into international editions, introducing workshops,
                product showcases, and keynote speeches from top technology pioneers. Today,
                TechCon stands as a hub for breakthrough ideas, emerging technologies, and
                future-defining research.
